The technologies selected are 
1. REST
2. gRPC
3. Message queues ( Kafka)

REST is used to handle low traffic endpoints. REST is also selected for endpoints, where development and maintenance has
preference over performance. 

In the project, person service is implemented using REST. And the location service is moved to gRPC.

gRPC is selected for services that has high intensity user activity. Location service is re-implemented using gRPC.

Kafka is used as a message queue for communication between the services. Here the location service acts as a message producer.
The produced messages are consumed by the location consumer service, which stores it to Postgres database.
